# T.T. TUI - A Terminal Typing Test

`T.T. TUI` is a fast, lightweight, and feature-rich typing test application that runs entirely in your terminal. Inspired by the clean aesthetic and core functionality of Monkeytype, `tttui` provides a focused, distraction-free environment to practice your typing skills, track your progress, and compete against your own personal bests.

## Showcase

#### The Typing Interface

A clean and focused interface shows only what you need while typing. The text is displayed centrally, with minimal status information at the top.

#### The Results Screen

After each test, you're presented with a detailed breakdown of your performance and a beautiful WPM graph. If you set a new record, you'll be celebrated!

## Installation

`tttui` is designed to be simple to install and run.

#### Prerequisites

-   Python 3

#### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stsagarino/tttui.git
cd tttui
```

#### 2. Make the Script Executable

Give the launch script execute permissions.

```sh
chmod +x bin/tttui.sh
```

#### 3. Run It!

You can now run the application directly.

```sh
./bin/tttui.sh
```

#### 4. (Recommended) Install System-Wide

For the best experience, move the executable to a directory in your system's `PATH`. This allows you to run `tttui` from any terminal, anywhere on your system.

```sh
sudo mv bin/tttui.sh /usr/local/bin/tttui
```

Now you can simply open a terminal and type `tttui` to launch the application.

## Usage

`tttui` is controlled entirely with the keyboard.

-   **Menu Navigation:** Use the `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys to navigate menus and `ENTER` to select.
-   **Go Back:** Press `TAB` to return to the main menu from a sub-menu.
-   **In-Test Commands:** During a test, press `TAB` to switch focus from the text area to the command bar at the bottom. Use the arrow keys and `ENTER` to `reset` the test or return to the `menu`.
-   **Quit:** Press `q` from the main menu or the results screen to quit the application.

## Customization

You can easily add your own themes and languages.

#### Adding a Theme

1.  Open `tttui/config.py`.
2.  Add a new dictionary entry to the `THEMES` dictionary. Follow the existing structure. You can use standard color names (`"red"`, `"blue"`, etc.) or 256-color codes (integers `0-255`).

    ```python
    "my_cool_theme": {
        "text_correct": ("green", -1),      # (foreground, background)
        "text_incorrect": ("red", -1),
        "text_untyped": (244, -1),
        "caret": ("black", "white"),
        "menu_highlight": ("black", "cyan"),
        "menu_title": ("cyan", -1),
    },
    ```
    *A value of `-1` for the background means it will be transparent.*

3.  Launch `tttui` and select your new theme from the theme menu.

#### Adding a Language / Wordlist

1.  Find the `tttui` configuration directory on your system. The application will create it automatically on first run at `~/.config/tttui/`.
2.  Inside that directory, you will find a `languages` folder.
3.  Simply add a new `.txt` file to this folder (e.g., `german.txt`). The file should contain words separated by newlines.
4.  The new language will automatically appear in the `language` menu in the app.
